# Programming: the good parts


This repo contains [the slides](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/regisb/pyconpk2024/main/slides.pdf) and code from my talk at [Pycon.pk](https://pycon.pk/) 2024.

## Running the code

Run the whitesquare game by installing [love2d](https://love2d.org/) and running:

    love whitesquare/

You can run flappycon in your browser, [right here](https://makecode.microbit.org/_48e4P0gmzd24), or copy microbit-flappycon.hex to your [micro:bit](https://microbit.org/) device.

To run starfighter2000, download first the ball.gltf.blb file from [Kay Kit's Mini Game Adventure Pack](https://kaylousberg.itch.io/kay-kit-mini-game-variety-pack) (huge props to Kay Kit for providing these assets for free). Place the file in the `starfighter2000/assets`. Then, bexecute the following:

    cd starfighter2000/
    pip install -r requirements
    ./starfighter2000.py

## Additional resources

## [Hour of Code](https://code.org/hourofcode)

This is a great project to get people started with programming. Children as young as 6 year old can try it out, under the guidance of a mentor.

### "Base" games

These games are barebone, they don't have any graphics or sound. It's up to the students to create the assets and add some custom code. Note that everything is in French, and that's on purpose because our audience does not speak English:

- [Base Asteroids Race](https://github.com/aucoindujeu/base-asteroidsrace)
- [Base Bubble Bobble](https://github.com/aucoindujeu/base-bubblebobble)
- [Base Car Race](https://github.com/aucoindujeu/base-carrace)
- [Base Minishooter](https://github.com/aucoindujeu/base-minishooter)

## Game jams

Game jams are a great way to work together on a common programming project. A huge list of ongoing jams are available at https://itch.io/jams.

## Extra resources in French

Our code club maintains a [list of resources](https://github.com/aucoindujeu/codeclub/blob/main/love2d/Ressources.md) which you can translate and reuse.
